# Cow/Calf Cash Flow
An example cash flow budget for a small cow/calf operation 

Cow/ Calf Cash Flow Assumptions and Notes
Tyler Matteson, GSG 2017 Winter Conference
 
Assumed breed is Angus or similar, with good-on-grass type of genetics: birth weight of 70-90 lbs, mature female weight of 1100-1200 lbs
 
Rate of heifer calves is 50% in whole numbers, but the sample size is small enough that just one birth from a herd with an odd number of animals would throw this off. This data has been manipulated slightly to provide a clear and consistent example.
 
I have used the international letter designations for naming from the Beef Improvement Federation.
 
This breeding program uses a bull, owned year round. Other than feeding, he doesn’t play much into the cash flow, as the assumption is that he is changed out for an animal of similar cash value each year.

Average daily gain changes seasonally as animals have to spend more calories in the winter generating heat and fewer on growing. 

Daily feed requirement is assumed at 2.75% of the herd weight. 

Dry matter percentage for grass is assumed to yield at 800 lbs/ acre. This represents about 4" of grass, or a grazing height from 8" to 4" post-grazing. Rest periods are taken from the “Grazing Spreadsheet for NH from NRCS” 

Market price for cattle was pulled from the a combination of sources, gut checked for reliability:
USDA AMS monthly grass fed carcass report (Des Moines), specifically the “LS1100” report and the “lsmngbfbeef” reports.
https://www.ams.usda.gov/market-news/livestock-poultry-and-grain-list-reports
 
I also contacted them for some understanding of the volume of cattle going into these reports. The December report covers a “small sample size” - AMS won’t tell me the number of head. 
 
Assuming these are 5x5, 1100 lb round bales at a cost of $70/ bale at 15% moisture/ 85% dry matter. These are fields that should absolutely be modified to match your farm. 
 
For minerals, I’m just following the label of Kent Framework 365, which I was given a price of $28.42 for a 50 lb bag. At 3-4 (3.5) ounces per 1200lb animal per day, this works out to consumption of 0.000182lbs per pound of cow per day at a cost of $0.5684/ pound.
 
Fencing costs are taken from this Iowa State study, which is both comprehensive and easy to read. Since the natural topography of is much flatter than that of New Hampshire, I would suggest calculating an elevation change factor for your farm by calculating the grade (as a percentage):
 
((rise/run)+1) x Fence		(((710-550) / 1200) + 1) = 1.1333 [from Matteson Farm in Epsom, NH]
 
The spring fence cost is a replacement of 1/4 of all the polywire and posts, assuming you have four paddocks worth of polywire and no more. The fall expense is based on the maintainence costs for the perimeter of that largest pasture required acerage. These numbers are probably conservative; it's easy to spend a lot of money on fence.

Slaughter Costs are from data I’ve collected personally. Your abattoir can tell you their pricing scheme. Assumption here is $0.45/ lb.
 
Misc Variable costs are based on a 0.5% of herd weight. These would include things like halters, rope, random bits of hardware…
 
Interest costs are assumed at 5% APR
 
Facility repair is typically 3-4% of gross sales
 
Insurance for this farm is not going to exceed $2400 year, it could well be lower.
 
Misc Overhead is associated with things like office supplies (that are not used for marketing or retail) and other administrative expenses that aren’t worth calling out by themselves, typically 3-4% of sales.
